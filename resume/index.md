### ☂ A Brief Historical Account

Once upon a time I was a designer. Now I'm a totally legit developer! Cool story bro!

Seriously though, I really was a web-designer (and a Flash animator!) once.

But it always felt like work. Dabbling in development never did. I became more and more entrenched into the world of software development and less and less thrilled with the prospect of having to design yet another Hannah Montana homepage (while I think pink is a lovely color, I really disapprove of it as my day job).

Eventually it was obvious. It's a developers' life for me, yo ho ho!. A few months later and some intense woodshedding and wha-lah! Developer Time!

**FIN**
