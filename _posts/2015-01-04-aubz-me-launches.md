It feels good scratching an item off the ol' To-Do List I've been neglecting for far too long.

After work and personal projects, maintaining – let alone creating – a personal site ranks pretty low on the scale of _"Things I Like to do With My Free Time."_

Sadly, my past attempts have floundered after running into complex installation / hosting requirements, complicated interfaces, my distaste for Rich Text Editors, subscription fees, and sometimes my own laziness.

Luckily, an impromptu chat with a [friend] lead me to [Jekyll]; a really handy "blog-aware", static-site generator that eschews complex CMS and database for [Markdown] and static pages.

Finally I can create posts in my beloved Markdown, have complete control over my site, and never have to touch a CMS interface. Woot!

Look out for a post about my experience implementing Jekyll.

So, here's to Jekyll, this blog, and writing more. <span class="fa fa-beer"></span> Cheers!

Initial development involved approximately one _casual_ week to stand up and befriend Jekyll, create a custom design, and write this post. Not bad.
