It feels good to scratch off the ol' To-Do List an item that's been neglected for way too long. A few false starts and some expired domain names later; I finally got around to it.

After work projects and personal, for-fun, projects, maintaining – let alone creating – a personal site can rank pretty low on the scale of _"Things I Like to do With My Free Time."_

Luckily, an off-the-cuff chat, with a [friend and co-worker] of mine, lead me to [Jekyll]; a really handy "blog-aware", static-site generator that eschews complex CMS and database setups for [Markdown] and static pages – which is just perfect for me.

Look out for a post about my experience implementing Jekyll.

What I love about Jekyll is that I get to write my posts in Markdown. No shitty, rich text editor for me. Just simple, fast, efficient Markdown. It's almost a dream come true.

Maybe more importantly I can run this site locally, on my machine. This means I can work whenever I'm feeling inspired; Internet connection or no.

Additionally, I own all the content I write. I have the source locally and leverage GitHub for [free!] hosting and backup. A pretty nice setup if you ask me.

So, here's to writing more. <span class="fa fa-beer"></span> Cheers!

Initial development involved approximately one _casual_ week to stand up, befriend Jekyll, develop a custom design, and write this post. Not bad.
