Kelly's Dad, Kelly's Mom. AKA Jim and Mary.

Apologies for texting the link to this. It's been difficult to get much more than Mary's phone number without spoiling anything. Ha ha.
{: .notice}

I know it's been a spell (or two) since I took a somewhat early but necessary opportunity to ask permission to "make it official" (not my best wording ever) with Kelly. Ha ha.

### The First Order of Business, The Plan

Jim, you asked me what my plan was and (embarrassingly) I didn't really have an answer. I did promise to sort it out, though.

Well&mdash;I have!

It's been a few months in the making. You can check out the __The Plan__ by [clicking or tapping on this link][the plan].

### Now the Special Part

Jim, Mary,

Besides the, hopefully acceptable (and maybe exciting? ha ha), details of the __The Plan__ I wanted to write you two an extra message.

I wanted to thank you so much for accepting me into the Martineau fold, despite the distance between us. You two have been so welcoming and trusting that I am humbled by and can only hope that I've proved worthy of it.

Kelly is not only super neat, and nice, and caring, and wonderful she's also a really great human being. I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say that she has you two to thank for it.

You two have done a smashing job and I'm a totally lucky guy for it.

Even though the three of us haven't had a lot of one-on-one, I feel very close to you two through her and I very much look forward to being an _official_ part of the family.

I do hope __The Plan__ is acceptable. He he. Here's to hoping Kelly says&hellip;Yes!

I think it's a safe bet, but you never know!
