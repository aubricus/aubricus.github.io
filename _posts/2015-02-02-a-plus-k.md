### OMG!

With only two weeks left, I'm a bit behind with this announcement. What's new. Ha ha.

### The Sound of a Distant Question Popping...

As you may know, Kelly and I have been together for over three years. Together through the good and the bad, the ecstatic and the frustrating, the worrisome and celebratory time we've both grown a lot. The beautiful part is that our Journey together has been a true partnership and we're both better people for it.

The relationship Kelly and I share is a rare gift. And it's for that reason, among many, that I've decided to ask her to marry me! Yay!

### First, A Clever Ruse

> Ok, maybe not so clever (ha ha)

Kelly loves camping. I've never (really) been. While pining over how to set this up, preferably somewhere memorable and not cheesy, it came to me&mdash;What if I asked her to go camping? We could share a fun adventure that would come to a (hopefully) brilliant end!

Last year, for my birthday, Kelly and I took a miniature road trip up Pacific Highway 1 to Big Sur and Carmel. To date, one of the most beautiful wildernesses I've seen. I mean, the ocean plus the woods?! Crazy!

On the way home we stopped at a wonderful little spot called [Sand Dollar Beach]:

This was one of our favorite spot on the trip. The water is so clear and blue. It was off-season and no one was around. We (and the pups) had the whole beach to ourselves.

I thought to myself: "Myself, this is the perfect spot."

Luckily there's a couple campgrounds nearby, and we've already made reservations at [Plaskett Creek]:

### So here's the plan:

1. <del>Ask Kelly to go camping!</del>
2. <del>Reserve camping site!</del>
3. <del>Get camping gear!</del>
4. Have a day of romantic and fun hiking / camping.
5. End up at Sand Dollar beach near the end of the day.(around sunset)
6. Remove ring secretly packed into backpack.
7. Ask my wonderful lady if she'll go steady&mdash;permanently!

### Now to the Shiny Bauble

Here's a preview of the ring:

Kelly and I "shopped" (meaning I slyly sent her web links to "checkout" to get her "opinion" on some ambiguous future engagement) for this ring at [Brilliant Earth]; a wonderful, on-line ring store that employs [earth and humanity friendly practices][ehfp].

The picture is from the [Brilliant Earth] site, but it's almost identical to the one I received. Sadly, it does it no justice.

Real pictures coming soon!

I've had the ring since November or so. Currently the ring is sitting, hidden, in a guitar case, just feet from where Kelly sleeps. Ha ha.

>Some morose part of me chuckles at this.

### Wish Me Luck!

It's all going down between __February 14<sup>th</sup>__ (oh dang! right on Valentine's Day Weekend!? Such a stud!) __and 17<sup>th</sup>__ and, so far, the plan has come together nicely. I'm currently planning on that Sunday, around sunset, to drop a knee and say mushy heartfelt things all while holding a shiny, sunset-reflecting bauble.

Wish me luck!!!
